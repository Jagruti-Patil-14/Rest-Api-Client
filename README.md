Description:In modern software development, REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are widely used for communication between different systems, enabling applications to interact with remote services efficiently. Building a REST API client in Java allows a program to consume these APIs by sending HTTP requests and handling responses. Java offers various libraries and frameworks to implement REST API clients, such as HttpURLConnection, Apache HttpClient, and the HttpClient class introduced in Java 11. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of creating a REST API client in Java, covering its components, steps, and best practices.
A REST API client is an application or component that communicates with a RESTful web service. It performs operations like sending HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to a server and processing the responses. The client interacts with endpoints provided by the REST API and exchanges data, usually in JSON or XML formats.

Key Components of a REST API Client
HTTP Requests: The client sends requests to specific endpoints using HTTP methods:

GET: Fetch data from the server.
POST: Submit data to the server.
PUT: Update existing data on the server.
DELETE: Remove data from the server.
Endpoints: These are URLs where the server listens for requests, often accompanied by query parameters or request bodies.

Headers: Additional information, such as content type, authentication tokens, and custom metadata, is sent with the request.

Response Handling: The client processes the server's responses, including parsing status codes, headers, and response bodies.
